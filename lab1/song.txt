Lips red as blood,
Eyebrows as black as night!..
— Give me your soul,
A human daughter.

I'm chopping pines, I'm chopping spruce:
Young, old, dead, alive
– Chasing away squirrels, destroying nests,
Hitting woodpeckers with an axe.
And I'm not ashamed, and I'm not sorry
– Because I'm iron,
Because the woodcutter: There is no heart, there is no soul
– What questions can there be?
.. hey, girl, come here,
Show your heart!
